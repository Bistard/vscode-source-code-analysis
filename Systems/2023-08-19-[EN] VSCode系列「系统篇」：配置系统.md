# Configuration System

I divided the configuration system into the following critical components:

1. `ConfigurationRegistry` class - Registers configurations for different software components.
2. `ConfigurationService` - Main process microservice.
3. `WorkspaceService` - Renderer process microservice.

## 1. Configuration Registration

> Prerequisites: Familiarity with `IJSONSchema` and the concept of `Registry`.

Letâ€™s first introduce some basic interfaces.

### `IConfigurationPropertySchema` Interface

- `IConfigurationPropertySchema` extends `IJSONSchema` by adding new fields.
- Each `IConfigurationPropertySchema` can be understood as a single configuration item.
    - For instance, `font size: 12px` is a single configuration.

### `IConfigurationNode` Interface

- Each node contains a set of `IConfigurationPropertySchema` (stored in the `properties` field). Thus, a node can be seen as a group of schemas or a configuration set.
    - Nodes can also be nested through the `allOf` field.
- `IConfigurationNode` is the fundamental unit for registering default configurations in `ConfigurationRegistry`. The APIs in `ConfigurationRegistry` generally take this interface as input.

### `ConfigurationRegistry` Class

- VSCode uses `ConfigurationRegistry` to register configurations (specifically `IConfigurationNode`).
    - **Note:** Configurations stored here are default configurations. The registry does not support updating configurations.

The actual configuration modification microservice in VSCode is called `ConfigurationService`.

#### Class Fields

- `configurationProperties`

    - Stores all registered configuration properties, including their default values. Related fields like `applicationSettings`, `machineSettings`, and `machineOverridableSettings` categorize properties by scope.
    - The `getConfigurationProperties` API returns this field. Other components access configurations through this frequently used API.

- `configurationDefaultsOverrides`

    - Stores default configuration overrides. When accessing a property, the system checks for override values in this field and uses them if available.

    > This enables extensions or other system parts to alter default behaviors without modifying the underlying code.

- `configurationContributors`

    - Tracks registered `IConfigurationNode` instances. Configurations are added via `register` and removed via `deregister`. The `getConfigurations` API provides access to this field, though itâ€™s rarely used.

## 2. `ConfigurationService` Main Process Microservice

- Created early in the program in the **main process** within the `CodeMain` class (though its files are located in the `common` directory).
- `ConfigurationService` has minimal code as most logic is delegated to other classes.

- This microservice does **not support** the `updateValue` API, meaning configuration modifications require reloading or editing the source configuration file (JSON).

    - The `WorkspaceService`, introduced later, supports the `updateValue` API.

- Key classes: `DefaultConfiguration`, `UserSettings`, and `Configuration` (I didnâ€™t delve into `IPolicyConfiguration` as it wasnâ€™t critical for understanding the system).

    - External programs fetch all configuration data from the `Configuration` class.

- Below is the constructor for `ConfigurationService` to give you a sense of the setup sequence:

```typescript
export class ConfigurationService extends Disposable implements IConfigurationService, IDisposable {
    declare readonly _serviceBrand: undefined;

    private configuration: Configuration;
    private readonly defaultConfiguration: DefaultConfiguration;
    private readonly policyConfiguration: IPolicyConfiguration;
    private readonly userConfiguration: UserSettings;
    private readonly reloadConfigurationScheduler: RunOnceScheduler;

    private readonly _onDidChangeConfiguration: Emitter<IConfigurationChangeEvent> = this._register(new Emitter<IConfigurationChangeEvent>());
    readonly onDidChangeConfiguration: Event<IConfigurationChangeEvent> = this._onDidChangeConfiguration.event;

    constructor(
        private readonly settingsResource: URI,
        fileService: IFileService,
        policyService: IPolicyService,
        logService: ILogService,
    ) {
        super();
        this.defaultConfiguration = this._register(new DefaultConfiguration());
        this.policyConfiguration = policyService instanceof NullPolicyService ? 
            new NullPolicyConfiguration() : 
            this._register(new PolicyConfiguration(this.defaultConfiguration, policyService, logService));
        this.userConfiguration = this._register(new UserSettings(this.settingsResource, undefined, extUriBiasedIgnorePathCase, fileService));
        this.configuration = new Configuration(this.defaultConfiguration.configurationModel, this.policyConfiguration.configurationModel, new ConfigurationModel(), new ConfigurationModel());

        this.reloadConfigurationScheduler = this._register(new RunOnceScheduler(() => this.reloadConfiguration(), 50));
        this._register(this.defaultConfiguration.onDidChangeConfiguration(({ defaults, properties }) => this.onDidDefaultConfigurationChange(defaults, properties)));
        this._register(this.policyConfiguration.onDidChangeConfiguration(model => this.onDidPolicyConfigurationChange(model)));
        this._register(this.userConfiguration.onDidChange(() => this.reloadConfigurationScheduler.schedule()));
    }

    async initialize(): Promise<void> {
        const [defaultModel, policyModel, userModel] = await Promise.all([
            this.defaultConfiguration.initialize(), 
            this.policyConfiguration.initialize(), 
            this.userConfiguration.loadConfiguration()
        ]);
        this.configuration = new Configuration(defaultModel, policyModel, new ConfigurationModel(), userModel);
    }
    // ...
}
```

> To understand the three classes mentioned earlier, letâ€™s first explore their shared base class: `ConfigurationModel`.

#### `ConfigurationModel` Class

- Stores configurations as an object.
- Adding values requires key-value pairs. Keys follow a predefined format:
    - Must be strings separated by `.`.
    - Example: `vscode` or `vscode.workspace.language`.
    - Data structure after adding values:

```typescript
{
   'vscode': {
      size: 5,
      name: 'hello world',
      'workspace': {
         'language': {
            lang: 'C++',
            restricted: true,
         }
      }
   }
}
```

#### `DefaultConfiguration` Class

- Located in `vscode\src\vs\platform\configuration\common\configurations.ts`.
- **`reset` API**
    - Fetches all default configurations via `ConfigurationRegistry.getConfigurationProperties()` and creates a `ConfigurationModel` to store these defaults.
- **`initialize` API**
    - Calls `reset` and listens to the `ConfigurationRegistry.onDidUpdateConfiguration` event to keep its model updated.

#### `UserSettings` Class

- Takes a `settingsResource` URI and uses an embedded `ConfigurationModelParser` to read the configuration file.
    - Parsing ensures data conforms to the schema defined in `ConfigurationRegistry`.
    - Invalid fields are filtered out during the parsing process.
- The parsed data is stored in a `ConfigurationModel`.

#### `Configuration` Class

Take a look at the initial lines of this class (I believe renaming it to something like `ConfigurationCollection` or `AllConfiguration` would be more fitting):

```typescript
export class Configuration {

    private _workspaceConsolidatedConfiguration: ConfigurationModel | null = null;
    private _foldersConsolidatedConfigurations = new ResourceMap<ConfigurationModel>();

    constructor(
        private _defaultConfiguration: ConfigurationModel,
        private _policyConfiguration: ConfigurationModel,
        private _applicationConfiguration: ConfigurationModel,
        private _localUserConfiguration: ConfigurationModel,
        private _remoteUserConfiguration: ConfigurationModel = new ConfigurationModel(),
        private _workspaceConfiguration: ConfigurationModel = new ConfigurationModel(),
        private _folderConfigurations: ResourceMap<ConfigurationModel> = new ResourceMap<ConfigurationModel>(),
        private _memoryConfiguration: ConfigurationModel = new ConfigurationModel(),
        private _memoryConfigurationByResource: ResourceMap<ConfigurationModel> = new ResourceMap<ConfigurationModel>()
    ) {
    }
   // ...
}
```

- During `ConfigurationService.initialize()`, `DefaultConfiguration` and `UserSettings` provide their `ConfigurationModel` instances to this class.
- The `Configuration` class consolidates all models based on the `DefaultConfiguration` model. Other configurations are merged into it.
- While verbose, most of the code handles integration and merging.

## 3. `WorkspaceService` Renderer Process Microservice

- <u>Only appears in the renderer process</u>, specifically in `web.main.ts` and `desktop.main.ts`.
- Despite its name, `WorkspaceService` is essentially the renderer process version of `ConfigurationService`.
- Unlike `ConfigurationService`, this service supports the `updateValue` API. See the `ConfigurationEditing` class for details.

### `ConfigurationCache` Class

- Since reading/writing configuration files in the renderer process (native or non-native/remote) involves asynchronous operations, all its interfaces return Promises.

```typescript
export type ConfigurationKey = { type: 'defaults' | 'user' | 'workspaces' | 'folder'; key: string; };

export interface IConfigurationCache {
    needsCaching(resource: URI): boolean;
    read(key: ConfigurationKey): Promise<string>;
    write(key: ConfigurationKey, content: string): Promise<void>;
    remove(key: ConfigurationKey): Promise<void>;
}
```

- A simple utility class offering `read`, `write`, and `remove` APIs for non-native configuration files.
    - Operates on the entire file (`content` in `write` is the full file content).
    - Each non-native configuration file is paired with a dedicated queue to ensure read/write operations are sequential.
    - Used by classes like `RemoteUserConfiguration`, `WorkspaceConfiguration`, and `FolderConfiguration`.
    - `DefaultConfiguration` and `UserConfiguration` rarely use this as their data is usually native.

- <u>Only appears in the renderer process</u>, specifically in `web.main.ts` and `desktop.main.ts`.

    - In `desktop.main.ts`, it's constructed like this:

```typescript
const configurationCache = new ConfigurationCache([Schemas.file, Schemas.vscodeUserData] /* Cache all non-native resources */, /* ... */);
const workspaceService = new WorkspaceService({ remoteAuthority: environmentService.remoteAuthority, configurationCache }, /* ... */);
```

### `DefaultConfiguration` Class

- Located in `vscode\src\vs\workbench\services\configuration\browser\configuration.ts`.
- Extends the `DefaultConfiguration` class from `\common\` but with no significant changes worth noting.

### `UserConfiguration` Class

- This class resides in the `browser` directory and primarily wraps the `UserSettings` class from the `common` folder.
- Notable during reloads: the embedded `UserSettings` can be replaced with a `FileServiceBasedConfiguration`. The exact purpose of this was not explored.

### `Configuration` Class

- The renderer process uses the same `Configuration` class as the main process, so thereâ€™s no need for repetition here.

### `ConfigurationEditing` Class - How Configurations Are Edited

- `WorkspaceService` enables updating configurations using `updateValue`, which relies on the key-value pair mechanism. The core function is `writeConfigurationValue`.
    - Does not support modifying default configurations.
    - Internally, `writeConfigurationValue` initializes a `ConfigurationEditing` instance and calls its API.
- `ConfigurationEditing` exposes a single API called `writeConfiguration`.
