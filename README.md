This repository is where I write my personal understanding of the VSCode framework/software development while reading the VSCode source code. The development of the entire repository is also a reflection of my learning process.

## Languages
While writing this series of blogs, I often mix English and Chinese, and some blogs are mainly in English. I won't have enough energy to complete the translation work in a short time.

## Contrbuting
Since I'm not an insider, my understanding might contain minor errors. You may raise an issue to help me improve.

## Table of Contents
I am willing to categorize all blogs into the following major sections:
1. Fundamentals
2. Tools and Technologies
3. Codebase Overview
   * Utilities
4. Architecture Overview
   * Main Process
   * Renderer Process
   * Shared Process
   * Extension Host Process
   * Monaco Editor
